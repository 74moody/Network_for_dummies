This is a dummy note for those who dont understand designing IP address(ipv4) scheme using VLSM.

# Getting the CIDR from geometric sequence.

Sequence is > 2^0 , 2^1 , 2^2 etc...
We will get:

1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 etc..

#getting the CIDR

in binary we have 32 bits right? "ipv4". So basically just substract 32 from number of bits("n") which is the 2^n. 

example:

2^7 which is 128, 32-7 = /25 

lets solve an example so we understand more!

Given: {
	IP address is 172.20.0.0/12
	Subnet: LAN A
	Number of hosts: 140
}

We need to find the following:
```
Network address

Subnet mask (Decimal)

CIDR Notation

First IP host address

Last IP host address

Number of usable hosts in subnet

Broadcast address

```

You need to always note that the first network address is reserverd for the network itself and the last is for the broadcast address. "0-255"

example: 192.168.0.0 < network address
192.168.0.255 < broadcast address
```

So the network address is: 172.20.0.0

For getting the subnetmask in decimal we need first to know the CIDR. 
Since we have 140 hosts we need to find a number that will be greater than or equal to 140.

Using this formula: 2^n - 2 >= 140.

is 2^0 to 2^7 greater than or equal to 140? NO
But is 2^8 greater than or equal to 140? yes 256.

# The number of bits that we need is the power of 8, so what we will do:
substract number of bits 32 by 8 which will be 24 and thats our CIDR.

32-8 = /24


now how to get the subnet mask in decimal?
Simply the number that we got which is 24 will be used in our 32 bits. 

to make it more simple, this 32 binary bits we will break it into 8-bit segments, 4.4.4.4:

imagine a light that has a switch that turns it off and on, ON indicates that the light is open which will be refered as 1 and OFF which is closed will be 0. 

our number is 24, imagining we want to turn on only the first 24 lights out of 32. which will be:
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 

128+64+32+16+8+4+2+1=255, adding these 8 bits together will give us 255.

so our answer is:
255.255.255.0 

```

Number of usable hosts in subnet?
This is pretty simple , the first and last host is reserved so .0 and .255 is excluded,
we will be left with .1 to .254 , .1 is the first IP host and .254 is the last.

Broadcast address: .255


so answers are:
Network address 172.20.0.0

Subnet mask (Decimal) 255.255.255.0

CIDR Notation /24

First IP host address 172.20.0.1

Last IP host address 172.20.0.254

Number of usable hosts in subnet: 254

Broadcast address: 255
